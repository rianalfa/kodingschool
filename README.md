# Koding School

This is a project built for my Bachelor degree's thesis. Koding School is a web-based online programming learning platform for students. The application offers three main features, which is

1. text-based materials which can be read by students to enhance their knowledge in programming,
2. instructions in each material which can be read and answered by students (by writing codes on a text editor provided by the application, which will later be examined by the application wether it's a correct answer or not) in order to advance to the next material (if needed),
3. gamification-based learning which was invented in hope that it would encourage students to study harder using this application.

In order to use this application, just run simple Laravel installation processes, like
1. **composer install**
2. **npm install**
3. **php artisan migrate**
4. **php artisan db:seed**
5. **npm run dev**
6. **php artisan serve**
